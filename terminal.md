# Terminal Snippets

Some useful commands I tend to have to google when using the terminal. My main machine is a Mac, so these commands should work on Unix/Linux systems in general but I haven't tested them at all outside of my local environment. For some commands, you may need to have certain tools (e.g. Pandoc) installed. 

**Move (or rename a file):**
```
mv <path/to/old.txt> <path/to/new.txt>
```
